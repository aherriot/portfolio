#Highway Three Solutions

Currently, I work for <a href="http://www.highwaythreesolutions.com" target="_blank">Highway Three Solutions</a>, a small web application company in Victoria, BC.  Most of my time is spent using javascript (JQuery, knockoutjs, JQGrid), SQL (Oracle, MySql), Java, and Struts to write software for the BC Ministry of Transportation. I have also done some work on Drupal sites using PHP and MySql as well. Another project involved converting large amount of government mainframe data into an Oracle DB using shell scripts and a series of PL/SQL Scripts.
