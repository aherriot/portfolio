#Highway Three Solutions

Currently, I work for Highway Three Solutions, where most of my time is spent using javascript (JQuery, knockoutjs, JQGrid), SQL (Oracle, MySql), Java, and Struts to write software for the Ministry of Transportation. I have also done some work on Drupal sites using PHP and MySql as well.
