<h1>LOUD Technologies</h1>

<p>Previously, I worked for LOUD Technologies, a large speaker company, and I worked on software used to control speakers.  The software was a combination of a venue modelling tool with speaker configuration and control. I worked in a team of three people doing a bit of everything, from front end GUI and OpenGL work to multi-threaded network programming and data simulation and modelling.
