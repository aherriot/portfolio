<h1>Highway Three Solutions</h1>

<p>Currently, I work for <a href="http://www.highwaythreesolutions.com" target="_blank">Highway Three Solutions</a>, a small web application company in Victoria, BC.  Most of my time is spent using javascript (JQuery, knockoutjs, JQGrid), SQL (Oracle, MySql), Java, and Struts to write software for the BC Ministry of Transportation.  I helped create an administration app for the National Safety Code project, which pulls in data from across the continent to assess whether commercial vehicles are meeting the safety standards.</p>

<p>I have also done some work on Drupal sites using PHP and MySql. Another project involved converting large amount of government mainframe data into an Oracle Database using shell scripts and a series of PL/SQL Scripts.</p>
