<h1>Carbonetworks</h1>

<p>
As a co-op student, I helped create a carbon emissions offset trading platform. The web-based platform brought carbon emitters and offsetters together in a markerplace for trading carbon credits.  The system was in the process of being ported from  ColdFusion to PHP RESTful API when I was there.  I used tools such as ExtJS and Google Visualizations to create charts and visualizations of emissions data.

	Users would use the widgets that I created that would automatically sync with MySql/PHP backend. Of course, I also wrote the SQL for these queries.
