#Carbonetworks

As a co-op student, I helped create a carbon emissions offset trading platform. The web-based platform brought emitters and offsetters together in a markerplace for trading carbon credits.  The system used Javascript (ExtJS)

Using Google Visualizations, I created charts and graphs that could be edited for inputting and displaying various information.
