<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<p>Blog software and content management software are often too complicated for their own good.  For this portfolio, I chose to use a static site generator called <a href="http://nanoc.ws/" target="_blank">Nanoc</a> instead.  Instead of using heavy backend software and a database to generate pages in real-time, nanoc will compile the webpage once, using templates, and create flat html files.  Webservers can serve up these pages really fast and the whole project can be stored in versioning control.  No need for databases, cumbersome setup and initializations, or other uneccessary complications.</p>
