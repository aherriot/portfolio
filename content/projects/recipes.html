#Recipes

I made an app to store and share recipes. Check it out at <a href="http://recipes.aherriot.com" target="_blank">recipes.aherriot.com</a>.

The initial idea for this website was to create a simple place to save my favourite recipes for quick reference and easy access.

For this project, I used a range of technologies, including Ruby on Rails, MySQL, nginx, unicorn, and OAuth2.

My secondary goal is to make a recipes in the form of flow charts, similar to the tables at the bottom of recipes at <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/33/Lemon-Bars" target="_blank">Cooking for Engineers</a>.  I would like to make it cleaner and more beautiful.  The challenge is making a great UI for the creation of flow chart recipes.  Right now, my implementation is not very easy to use for the majority of people.  I would also like to make it more mobile friendly.
