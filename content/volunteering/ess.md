I was the Director of Services of the Engineering Students' Society at the University of Victoria. In this position, I organized events for engineering students including charity fundraisers for the United Way, Queen Alexandria's Children's Hospital, and prostate cancer research.

Also, I oversaw the development of a PHP and SQL website for sales and inventory of events and merchandise. I created and maintained a content management system to help retain knowledge and promote communication.
